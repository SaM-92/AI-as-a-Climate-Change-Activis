 📢 A short talk about how we are using mathematics, statistics and AI (artificial intelligence) in energy systems...

👷🏻How we are translating engineering problems into mathematical models?👷🏻‍♀️


👨🏻‍🏫How we are applying optimisation techniques?


👩🏻‍💻How we are using AI to tackle climate change?


👩🏻‍💻How AI is helping us to reduce the time complexity?


🤖How we are bridging AI into optimisation problems?


 ✅ I discussed briefly about my recent collaboration with UCD School of Computer Science, where we developed a data-driven analytics platform for studying human mobility & power system operation during COVID-19 and Brexit in Ireland 🇮🇪

 ✅  I also talked shortly about how we built a machine learning model along with a smart control platform for assessing the flexibility from data centres in Ireland
